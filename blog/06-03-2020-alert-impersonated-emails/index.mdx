We have learned that emails impersonating Parity Technologies team members are being circulated from domains other than parity.io. We only use @parity.io emails when communicating with partners, clients and community; parity.com is owned by an entirely different company. If you have a question regarding whether an email is legitimate, please contact [security@parity.io](mailto:security@parity.io).
