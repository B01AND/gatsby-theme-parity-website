A short 6 weeks since Parity 1.0, I'm happy to announce Parity 1.1, codename Alacrity. This is a mid-term release (we're half-way to 1.2 Civility) with mostly "under-the-hood" improvements and optimisations since 1.0.

Our main features for Alacrity are:

* New JSONRPC APIs for tracking, tracing and inspecting all message-calls and balance transfers, including those that happen as "internal transactions";
* a simple web front-end to inspect how far you've synced, what your mining rate is and play around with the JSON RPC (just head over to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) once you're running parity -jw);
* for miners, a gas-price based upon the price of Ether, with automatic fetching from the web;
* auto option for --pruning, so after the first sync it'll automatically find the right method.

In addition, under-the-hood improvements include:

* Ubuntu 16.04 support;
* builds for ARM with Ubuntu Snappy packages available through our CI system;
* substantial refactoring and optimisation of the widely-used JSON codec;
* optimised mining code that allows acceptance of old nonces and yet keeps up to date with all incoming transactions.

We're very excited to get this out to you; you can find binaries on the [website](http://parity.io/) and GitHub release page. Get support in the [Parity Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/paritytech/parity).

Civility is now in active development and has features including full IPC compatibility for the wallet/Mist, a "bulletproof" actor/hypervisor architecture and an initial Proof-of-Authority consensus method. Look out for it in 6 weeks' time.

The Parity team.
