### Substrate development services, at scale.

Today we are happy to announce **Substrate Delivery Partners**, skilled blockchain development agencies (dev shops) familiar with Substrate. These teams will provide their expertise to deliver advanced, future-ready blockchain solutions based on Parity's [Substrate blockchain framework](https://parity.io/substrate). By utilizing Substrate Delivery Partners, enterprises and startups can reduce in-house development costs as well as time to market.

Parityâ€™s Runtime Engineering team is primarily available for helping external teams and customers build custom Substrate chains. However, we realized that in order to help build more solutions on Substrate, we must also enable external teams to provide Substrate development services. That led to the idea of Delivery Partners.

Substrate Delivery Partners are provided with training and technical help directly from the Parity team. This equips them with all the knowledge needed to build Substrate solutions.

The first set of delivery partners have already signed up and begun training. Keep an eye out for the upcoming Substrate Delivery Partners website that will feature more information about the program and its members. In the meantime, if you are interested in knowing more about the Delivery Partners and/or utilizing their services to build your Substrate-based solution, please reach out to us [here](https://www.parity.io/collaborate/).

If you are a blockchain development agency and are interested in becoming a Substrate Delivery Partner, please reach out to us [here](mailto:solutions@parity.io).
