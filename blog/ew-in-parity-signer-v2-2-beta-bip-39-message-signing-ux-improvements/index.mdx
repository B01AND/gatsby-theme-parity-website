Already available on the[ iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parity-signer/id1218174838) and[ Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.parity.signer), Parity Signer lets you generate, store, and safely sign transactions with your private key on devices that never connect to the internet.

We’ve added many new features in this release that allow broader support of address creation and recovery, and an improved user experience.

Turn your old smartphone into a hardware wallet by following the installation instructions below.

## **v2.2 Beta’s new features**

\- **BIP-39 support** for new addresses generated and recovering addresses generated with many other wallets using the [BIP-39 standard](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase), using 12 or 24-word mnemonic phrases. You will still be able to import "brain wallets" aka "Parity phrase" accounts.

\- **Message signing** is now supported with [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/). Now you can sign messages from accounts generated with Parity Signer.

\- [**Görli**](https://goerli.net/) **testnet** selection now exists in the UI alongside Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Kovan, and Ropsten networks.

\- **UX improvements** including easier account generation, better navigation, improved text input, and quicker QR code generation.

\- Parity Signer now uses the tried-and-tested **Rust crypto libraries.**

## **How to install and update securely**

Parity Signer is designed to run on a dedicated, offline device that will never connect to the internet once the app has been downloaded and installed. There are no critical updates in v2.2 Beta, so only update if you really need the new features. **Since we cannot guarantee the safety of your mobile phone, it is very important that you follow the instructions carefully in order to use Parity Signer as intended:**

1\. Get a mobile device that can remain offline (i.e., don’t use your everyday phone).

2\. Factory reset the device.

3\. Enable full-disk encryption on the device, with a reasonable password (might not be on by default, for example for older Android devices).

4\. Do not use any kind of biometrics such as fingerprint or face recognition for device decryption/unlocking, as those may be less secure than regular passwords.

5\. Once the App has been installed, enable airplane mode and make sure to switch off Wifi, Bluetooth or any connection ability of the device.

6\. Only charge the phone on a power outlet that is never connected to the internet. Only charge the phone with the manufacturer’s charging adapter. Do not charge the phone on public USB chargers.

## **How to use with MyCrypto**

Since[ April 2018](https://www.parity.io/send-transactions-with-mycrypto-beta-and-parity-signer/),[ MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/) gives users "watch-only" wallets when they log in using QR codes from Parity Signer.[ Head over to our wiki](https://wiki.parity.io/Parity-Signer-Mobile-App-MyCrypto-tutorial) to see a full tutorial—it's super simple.

## **Full audit coming soon**

While we believe the design makes this one of the most secure ways to store your Ethereum assets, we recommend using Parity Signer with caution by following the official instructions, and only storing small amounts on it. The cryptographic library used in Parity Signer was part of the[ Trail of Bits audit](https://www.parity.io/parity-technologies-appoints-trail-of-bits-to-lead-security-review/), and the application will be fully audited very soon. Parity Signer is[ completely open-source](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer). If you’re interested in helping us find bugs, check out[ our Bug Bounty Program](https://www.parity.io/bug-bounty/).

**IMPORTANT**: Current Parity Signer users: before upgrading, back up your private keys or send funds to another safe address.

## **More features coming soon**

We plan on releasing an update to Parity Signer to support Substrate-specific transaction format.

[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) is built on[ Substrate](https://parity.io/substrate), a powerful framework for building next-generation custom blockchains, and soon Parity Signer will support Substrate blockchains out-of-the-box.

Turn your old smartphone into a dedicated hardware wallet by downloading Parity Signer for free on the[ **iOS App Store**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parity-signer/id1218174838) and[ **Google Play Store**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.parity.signer).
