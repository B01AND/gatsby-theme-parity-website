We have investigated reports of some Parity Ethereum nodes not syncing and believe there may be an attack underway. New releases v2.6.8-beta & v2.5.13-stable protect against this. [Download the update here.](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases)

**Please update your nodes to the newest version ASAP,** whether or not you may be experiencing issues.
