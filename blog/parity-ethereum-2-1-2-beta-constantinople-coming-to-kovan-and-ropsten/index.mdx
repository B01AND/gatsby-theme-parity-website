Parity Ethereum 2.0.7-stable and 2.1.2-beta were released today, marking a major step toward the Constantinople hard fork on the Ethereum mainnet. Today's release includes Constantinople support for the Kovan and Ropsten networks, as well as the [POA Core mainnet Hard Fork 2](https://github.com/poanetwork/wiki/wiki/HFs-Core-2018-10-22). Along with many improvements and optimizations, support for EIPs [145](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-145.md), [1014](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1014.md), [1052](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1052.md), [1234](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1234.md)*, and [1283](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1283.md) are included and will activate on Ropsten and Kovan on the following dates:

* Ropsten: Block #4,230,000 - October 14th, 2018
* Kovan: Block #9,200,000 - October 25th, 2018

If you are running one of the above networks using [Parity Ethereum](https://www.parity.io/ethereum/), we recommend to update as soon as possible. Once enough time has passed after the network upgrades on Kovan and Ropsten, Ethereum core devs will decide on a block number for Constantinople activation on the mainnet.

There are many other small optimizations for this release of Parity Ethereum, including a hard fork for the [POA Core mainnet](https://blockscout.com/poa/core) at block #5,329,160 (October 22nd, 2018).

\* Note: Kovanâ€™s hard fork does not include EIP-1234.
