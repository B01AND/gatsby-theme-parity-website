On February 3rd, we received several reports that an attacker can send a specially-crafted RPC request to a public Parity Ethereum node (any version pre 2.2.9-stable and pre 2.3.2-beta) and that node will crash.

## **Who’s affected?**

Affected Parity Ethereum nodes are those that serve JSONRPC as a public service.

## **Who’s not directly affected?**

Parity Ethereum nodes who don’t serve JSONRPC to third parties on the internet—i.e., most nodes—should not be directly affected. The default mode is to not serve JSONRPC publicly.

## **Fix available—update ASAP**

Releases 2.2.9-stable and 2.3.2-beta **are now available** and fix this issue. [Download them here.](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases)

**Please update your nodes to the newest version ASAP**, especially if you’re running a publicly-facing JSONRPC endpoints. Nodes with \`--auto-update=all\` flag set will receive the updates automatically.

## **Bug bounty program**

Thanks to Kosala Hemachandra from MyEtherWallet for being the first to bring this to our attention. As always, we welcome and reward bug findings as per our [bug bounty program](https://www.parity.io/bug-bounty/).
