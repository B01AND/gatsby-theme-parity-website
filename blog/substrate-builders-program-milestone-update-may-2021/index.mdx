The [**Substrate Builders Program**](https://www.substrate.io/builders-program/) is an initiative by Parity to support builders in the Substrate ecosystem. The program allows teams building Substrate-based blockchains, applications, or ecosystem components to benefit from Parity’s extensive experience and resources, thereby setting themselves up for success.

There are over 50 projects that have been accepted into the Substrate Builders Program, including projects in the areas of DeFi, gaming, identity, oracles and many others. These teams receive support for technical challenges, strategy, and ecosystem building support.

Projects in the Builders Program are allocated to one of three tracks: the Infrastructure Track, the Chains Track, or the Application Track. Teams accepted into the Substrate Builders Program receive support from Parity on their technical and community roadmaps, outlying major milestones to achieve their goals and launch their project. Projects building applications, chains, and infrastructure components are guided along the way with continuous support and incentives.

This month we are excited to announce that several teams have achieved their first milestone in the recent weeks. Below are the teams along with the work completed as part of achieving the milestone.

## Chains track

[**DeeperNetwork**](https://deeper.network/) aims to build a new web with decentralized private networks, DNS, gateway, and a DApp store.

[**Patract**](https://patract.io/) is building an open Wasm smart contract platform for Polkadot.

* Launched the Jupiter testnet, a Wasm smart contract network powered by Substrate FRAME Contracts pallet
* Delivery of Ask!, a smart contract language designed based on AssemblyScript and running on Substrate FRAME Contracts
* Proposal completed for Himalia SDK, which will provide FRAME Contracts SDK supports in a multi-language environment to support WASM DApp development
* Europa v0.1 completed, a sandbox environment that runs FRAME Contracts pallet and sandbox framework for Substrate Runtimes
* First draft of PatraStore, a Polkadot.js-based DApp interface for applications built on Patract

## Applications Track

[**dTrade**](https://dtrade.org/) is a decentralised trading platform for options and perpetuals contracts.
